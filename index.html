            <img src="apjkalam.jpeg" alt="Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam">
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, Indian scientist and honorable 11th president (2002-2007) of India, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He played a leading role in developing missile and nuclear weapon projects, which earned him the nickname "The Missile Man."</p>
            <p>Kalam was a simple and unpretentious person who lived a modest lifestyle. He had a keen interest in literature and wrote poems. He never married and always faced the media himself for his failures while letting others address his success. He remained active until the very end, delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management when he collapsed and passed away on July 27, 2015.</p>
